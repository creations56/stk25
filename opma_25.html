<br />
This "on line" calculator does mathematical calculations using the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which has been widely implemented in the Hewlett Packard calculators' starting in the 1970's ( more informations on the old HP calculators are available <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org">there</a>).<br>
This means that it uses a "computation stack" (registers referenced as <em>x, y, z</em>) to perform computational operations<br />

<b>How to enter a number in the computation stack ?</b><br />
This is done using the number keys (the white ones and the grey ones) to set the number in the <em>x</em> register. Then, with the <span class="cg">ENTER</span> key, the entering process is conclued.<br /><br />
</div>
<b>How to perform a computation using the stack ?</b><br />
<div class='gris'>
Example: adding 4.5 to 3.8
<ul>
  <li> with the white keys, tap in <span class='cw'>3</span> <span class='cw'>.</span> <span class='cw'>8</span>which displays in the x register.
    <li>tap the <span class='cg'>ENTER</span> key. The input is set in the <em>x</em> register (computation stack)</li>
      <li> with the white keys again, tap in <span class='cw'>4</span> <span class='cw'>.</span>  <span class='cw'>5</span>which displays in the <em>x</em> display. Notice that the previous value (3.8) has been moved up to the y register.
     <li>tap the  <span class='cg'>ENTER</span>  key again. The value is set in the x register. We have now 3.8 in the y register and 5.5 in the x register </li>   
     <li>tap the <span class="cb">+</span> key (a blue one). The y register is added to the x one which now displays the 8.3 value</li>
</ul>
Notice : if you tap directly the <span class='cb'>+</span> key after entering the second value (skipping the second <span class='cg'>ENTER</span> key), the calculator will perform the entering step automatically. This will speed up the process.
</div>


<h2>The display area</h2>

<div class='centered'>
   <img src="images/img2.jpeg" alt="display" width="80%"/>
</div>
<div class='left'>
  
  This area includes :
  <ul>
    <li>the <em>stack</em> area which includes the computation registers named <em>x, y, z</em> and the memory register named <em>mem</em></li>
    <li>The <em>modes</em> area includes the setting buttons for the angle measurement unit, the display mode (fixed or scientific, number of decimales).<br /> 
  <span class='cg'>DEG</span> for degree. All trigonometric calculations will be done using the degree unit<br />
  <span class='cg'>RAD</span> for radian. All trigonometric calculations will be done using the radian unit<br />
  <span class='cg'>D+</span> for decimal +. Increase the number of displayed decimals by one. Notice that the number of decimals is limited to 8<br />
  <span class='cg'>D-</span> for decimal -. Decrease the number of displayed decimals by one. Notice that the minimum number of decimals is 0<br />
  <span class='cg'>FIX</span> for fixed mode. Set the fixed mode where numbers are represented directly, without exponent.<br />Notice : some numbers, big ones, or with lot of displayed decimals, could be to large to be displayed (more than 16 characters). When this happen the calculator will automatically move to the scientific mode. A warning message will be displayed in the info display<br/>
  <span class='cg'>SCI</span> for scientific mode. Number are displayed with a mantissa and an exponent. Example: 123.45 is displayed as 1.23e+2<br />
     <li>This mode area shows also, below the setting keys, in <span class="vert">green</span>, the selected values.</li>
    <li>The <em>warning</em> area shows, when needed, a temporary warning message.Those are:
      <br>
      <span class="rouge">large number, SCI mode set </span> the computed number is too large to be displayed in the FIX mode. <br /> 
      <span class="rouge">unvalid operation</span> operation such as /0, LOG(0)...<br /> 
      <span class="rouge">&#9432 hh.mmss display for x </span> reminder : after pressing the  <span class="cj">dec>hms</span> key, the x display shows no more decimal value but hh.mmss value<br /> 
      </li>
  </ul>  
</div>


<h2>The keyboard area</h2>

<div class='centered'>
   <img src="images/img3.jpeg" alt="keyboard" width="80%"/>
</div>
<div class='left'>
  <br />
  The keys are organized in 4 main categories:
  <ul>
    <li>the white keys, including the figures from 0 to 9, the decimal point, the minus sign... that is to says the ones used to enter a new number</li>
    <li>the grey key which are related to stack and memory manipulations, display modes... </li>
    <li>the blue keys which are used to perform mathematical operations </li>
    <li>the yellows keys which are used to perform conversion operations </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class='left'>
  <h3>The white keys</h3>
  <span class='cw'>0</span> to <span class='cw'>9</span></span> numbers<br />
  <span class='cw'>.</span> decimal point<br />
  <span class='cw'>-</span> minus sign, used to enter negative numbers or a negative exponent. Example : -123 or 456E-3. It should not be confused with the mathematical operation minus, which substact one number to an other one.<br />
  <span class='cw'>E</span> exponent sign <br />
  <span class='cw'>PI</span> enter the mathematical Pi value into the x register<br />
  <span class='cw'>C</span> for clear. Remove the last entered sign from the input register (x)<br />
  <span class='cw'>AC</span> for all clear. Erase the input register (x)
</div>

<div class='left'>
  <h3>The grey keys</h3>
  <span class='cg'>ENTER</span> finalize the entering process of a new value in the x register. <br />
  <span class='cg'>STO</span> for store. The current x value is stored in the memory register. <br />Notice : storing a value in the memory doesn't erase it from the x register<br />
   <span class='cg'>RCL</span> for recall. The stack is moved up and the current memory value is stored in the x register.<br />Notice: recalling a value from memory doesn't erase it from the memory register<br />
  <span class='cg'>DUP</span> for duplicate the x register. y is moved to z, and y is set to x <br /> 
  <span class='cg'>DROP</span> for dropping. The stack is moved down: x is set to y ,y is set to z. z is set to 0. Notice that the original x value is lost<br />
  <span class='cg'>SWAP</span> for swap. The values of the x register and the y one are exchanged<br />
