This "on line" calculator does mathematical calculations using the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which has been widely implemented in the Hewlett Packard calculators' starting in the 1970's ( more informations on the old HP calculators are available there).
This means that it uses a "computation stack" (registers referenced as x, y, z) to perform computational operations
